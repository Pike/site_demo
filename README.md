Django BuildDB Demo site
========================

This is just a proof of concept demo site to show how to create a django site 
on top of django_moz_status and coconut.

It's intentionally non-pretty, just pull all three git repos next to each other.
Patches to make this more virtualenv are welcome.

This works on data dumps provided by 
[BuildAPI](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/BuildAPI).
